# Task 1-B: Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes

This task builds a foundational understanding of containerization and orchestration. You will first learn how Docker packages applications into isolated, reproducible units called containers. After that, you will explore Kubernetes, a system designed to deploy, scale, and manage many containers in production environments. Mastering these fundamentals will prepare you for the next task, where we will set up a simple microservice architecture and later introduce controlled fault injection (chaos experiments) to test system resilience.

## Objective

Before moving to container orchestration with Kubernetes, this task will help you understand what Docker containers are, why they are used, and how they operate. You will then gain a conceptual and hands-on overview of Kubernetes so that you can confidently deploy distributed microservices in the upcoming tasks.

## Additional Resources (Optional)

- YouTube Playlist for *Learn Docker in a Month of Lunches*:

After completing these materials, you should be comfortable with basic container lifecycle operations, image creation, and Kubernetes primitives such as pods, services, and deployments. This understanding will form the basis for the next task, where we will implement a minimal microservice and later apply chaos testing to evaluate system behavior under failure conditions.
